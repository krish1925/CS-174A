# CS174A @UCLA - Winter 2024

## Overview

Welcome to the repository for CS174A at UCLA, taught by Professor Ashish Law. This repository contains assignments coded in JavaScript and TinyGL (a subset of OpenGL) focusing on fundamental principles in computer graphics.

## Course Topics

Throughout the course, we explored various topics in computer graphics, including:

- Basic principles behind modern two- and three-dimensional computer graphics systems
- Complete set of steps that modern graphics pipelines use to create realistic images in real time
- Positioning and manipulation of objects in scene using geometric and camera transformations
- Creation of final images using perspective and orthographic transformations
- Basics of modeling primitives such as polygonal models and implicit and parametric surfaces
- Basic ideas behind color spaces, illumination models, shading, and texture mapping

## Repository Contents

- **Assignments**: Contains assignments completed as part of the CS174A course curriculum.
- **Technologies**: Utilizes JavaScript and TinyGL for coding assignments and projects.
